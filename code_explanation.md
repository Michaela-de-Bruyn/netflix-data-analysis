## Netflix Data Analysis â€” Code Breakdown
Welcome to the detailed breakdown of the Netflix data analysis project code. Below you will find explanations for each part of the code, its purpose, and how it helps answer the project objectives. Screenshots of the outputs and graphs are included for easy reference.

## 1. Importing Libraries and Loading Data:


Explanation:
We import essential libraries:
pandas for data manipulation,
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
The dataset netflix_titles.csv is loaded into a DataFrame df for analysis.

df.head() displays the first few rows to quickly inspect the data.

## 2. Checking for Missing Values:

Explanation:
This line checks each column for missing values to identify incomplete data.
Understanding missing data helps in planning cleaning steps to improve analysis accuracy.

## 3. Content Type Distribution



Explanation:
Counts how many Movies and TV Shows are in the dataset.
Visualizes the counts using a bar chart to easily see which content type dominates.
This insight addresses the first project objective about content distribution.

## 4. Yearly Release Trends


Explanation:
Counts and sorts the number of titles released each year.
Plots a line graph showing how content releases have changed over time.
Helps identify trends or spikes in Netflix content production.
